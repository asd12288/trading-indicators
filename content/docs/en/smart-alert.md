# Smart Alerts System ðŸ””

Smart Alerts are the core feature of Trader Map, providing you with intelligent market monitoring and timely notifications.

## What Are Smart Alerts?

Smart Alerts go beyond simple price alerts by combining multiple market factors to generate high-probability trade signals. Our algorithm analyzes:

- **Price action patterns**
- **Volume profiles**
- **Market structure**
- **Volatility conditions**
- **Support and resistance levels**

## Types of Smart Alerts

### Entry Alerts

Entry alerts notify you of potential trade opportunities based on your pre-defined criteria.

```json
{
  "alertType": "entry",
  "instrument": "EURUSD",
  "direction": "buy",
  "price": 1.0850,
  "confidence": 85,
  "triggers": ["price_pattern", "support_level", "volume_surge"]
}
```

### Exit Alerts

Exit alerts help you manage your open positions and secure profits or minimize losses.

### Pattern Recognition Alerts

These alerts identify specific chart patterns that often precede significant price movements.

### Volume Anomaly Alerts

Notifies you when unusual trading volume occurs, which often precedes major market moves.

## Setting Up Alerts

To create a new Smart Alert:

1. Navigate to the Alerts dashboard
2. Click "Create New Alert"
3. Select the instrument you want to monitor
4. Choose the alert type
5. Configure the specific parameters
6. Set your notification preferences

## Alert Delivery Methods

- **In-app notifications**
- **Email alerts**
- **SMS messages**
- **Mobile push notifications**
- **Webhook integrations**

## Advanced Alert Configuration

For professional traders, we offer:

### Conditional Logic

Create complex alerts using AND/OR conditions:

```
IF price crosses above 50 SMA
AND volume is 50% above average
AND RSI is below 30
THEN trigger alert
```

### Alert Templates

Save and reuse your most effective alert configurations across multiple instruments.

### Backtesting Alerts

Test how your alert configuration would have performed historically to refine your strategy.

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic alerts before creating complex conditions
2. **Use Multiple Timeframes**: Confirm signals across different timeframes
3. **Combine with Manual Analysis**: Use alerts as a starting point for your analysis
4. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and optimize your alert settings
